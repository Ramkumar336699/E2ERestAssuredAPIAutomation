    1. JUnit - we will write Unit test cases for the piece of code we write
    2. TestNG - Easy to use testing framework written in Java
                Designed for unit, functional and E2E integration tests
                you can use it with API Testing and UI Testing
                Provides features like parallel testing, multi threading execution and annotations support
                TestNG supports multiple plugin and can be integrated easily with existing frameworks
    3. TestNG
          -> Reporting
          -> Parallel Execution
          -> Annotations support
          -> Multi Threading Support
          -> Easy Integration
          -> Open Source
          -> Better than JUnit Framework
     4. How to write Test in TestNg
          -> Create a method and add your logic in that method
          -> Mark that method as @Test
          -> Add required annotations like
                i. Description
               ii. Group
              iii. Priority
               iv. Enabled
     5. PreTests(PreLogic), Tests and PostTests(PostLogic)
     6. PreTests - Database(), loadMyConfigurations(), setUpMyTestData(), readFile(), whichEnv()
     7. PostTests - closeDB(), callGarbageCollector(), closeFile()
     8. Other TestNG annotations - @Parameter, @DataProvider and @Factory
