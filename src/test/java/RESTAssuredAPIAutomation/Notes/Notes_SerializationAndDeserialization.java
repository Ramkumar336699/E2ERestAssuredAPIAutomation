    Serialization:
         1. Convert an Object into Byte Stream while sending - Serialize
         2. and then convert Byte Steam to Object while receiving - Deserialize

    Why we are doing Serialization and Deserialization?
         1. The Language we are using is JAVA - whatever the Payload and Response which is coming right in JAVA
            we want to work with object but Network while sending - JSON that's why we use Serialize and Deserialize.
