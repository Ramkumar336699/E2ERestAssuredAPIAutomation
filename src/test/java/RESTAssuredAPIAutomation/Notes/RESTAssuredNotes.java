    /* REST Assured:
           1. REST Assured is a JAVA Domain Specific Language (DSL) API used for writing automated test cases
              for RESTFUL API's.
           2. It is used to invoke REST web services for POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH and HEAD requests
              and validate the response.
           3. REST Assured is Builder Pattern - call a multiple methods by single call - 29th JAN call at 1:20
           4. REST Assured is a BDD - Given(), When() and Then()

       Approach:
            a. Rest Assured:
                  i. HTTP Method
                 ii. Validation - Hamcrest
            b. Validation:
                  i. AssertJ
            c. Payload Management
                  i. JSON and Payload --> POJO
                 ii. GSON
                iii. Jackson
            d. Test Framework
                  i. TestNG
            e. Report
                  i. Allure Report --> Allure HTML
                 ii. ReportNG --> By TestNG
            f. Maven
                  i. Project Build and Dependency

       Benefits:
            1. Contains tons of helper methods and abstraction layers.
            2. seamless integration with JAVA, TestNG
            3. Easy to understand DSL
            4. It will remove a need for writing a lot of boilerplate code.....

      How you Do?
         --> HTTP Methods, HTTP Headers, URL (Base Path & Base URI), Cookies, Param, Body, Response, Assert the Response
         --> GIVEN() - Headers, Params, Message Body, Authentication
         --> WHEN()  - HTTP Method - GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
         --> THEN()  - Response, Validate Response
